# Muse Spotify Dashboard - overview

## About

## Source

Original dateset comes from Kaggle repository owned by Tim Buck - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timbuck/muse-album-songs-data-from-spotify


## Analitycal Questions

I used ideas for simple analitycal tasks also from Kaggle. There are all described below:

1. Which album has the longest songs?
2. Has the mood of songs gotten happier, sadder, or remained the same throughout Muse's career?
3. Is there any correlation between popularity and key, energy or danceability?
